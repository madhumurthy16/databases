1. What data types do each of these values represent?

A: 
"A Clockwork Orange" - String
42 - Integer
09/02/1945 - Date

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used. 
A:  
A database is used when we need a way to store data that makes it easy to search for specific data, handle multiple applications accessing the data, and have data persist beyond the end of a particular application process. 

A text file is used to store data that is used by a program during the execution and which does not persist beyond the end of the program.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is declarative, whereas most other programming languages are procedural languages.

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm where we tell the program “What” to do instead of worrying about how exactly something needs to be done.
Procedural programming is a sub-paradigm of the imperative programming paradigm. In imperative programming paradigm we tell program “How” to do something step-by-step or solve problem exactly.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level. 

A: A database is an application that allows users to manage data through an interface, either a command line or a GUI. We can also set up a database as a application on a server, so another machine can send requests through the server to get data (web API’s). Databases store data in a binary file format, that are not human readable. Within the files are specialized structures that allow the database system to quickly read and change data.

Databases display data using a table structure with columns that define what the data represents and rows that make up a complete conceptual unit. We use Structured Query Language(SQL) to query and manipulate the data in the databases. The strength of databases lies in the ability to perform the various queries. 
5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: 
Table: A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of columns and rows. In relational databases a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns (identifiable by name) and horizontal rows , the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect. A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.

Row: In the context of a relational database, a row represents a single, implicitly structured data item. In simple terms, each row in a table represents a set of related data and every row in the table has the same structure.

Column: In a relational database table , columns define what the data represents. A column is a set of data values of a particular data type, one value for each row of the database.

Value: A value is a piece of data or some information that the column name describes and is stored in a table cell (the intersection of the column and row). 
6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
	1. String
	2. Integer
	3. Float
